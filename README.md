# LCA-AW-Lexical-Complexity-Analyzer-for-Academic-Writing
LCA-AW (Lexical Complexity Analyzer for Academic Writing, Nasseri and Lu, 2019); version 2.1. This code is a modified version of the LCA (lexical complexity analyzer, described in Lu, 2012). The modified version integrated the BAWE (British Academic Written English) corpus' word list, the bawe_list.txt, that is a list of most frequently-used academic writing words in linguistics-related disciplines and language studies. The BNC-British National Corpus (or an option to use ANC- American National Corpus,) and the BAWE word lists act as filters for calculating lexical sophistication indices (see Lu, 2012). LCA-AW, will be suitable for analysing lexical complexity of academic writing in linguistics-related disciplines.
